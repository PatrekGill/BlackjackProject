# Blackjack Project

## Description
A very simple console based Blackjack game with multiple player support. This project was a demonstration of APIE and general OOP. The main is located in the `src/com/skilldistillery/main/BlackjackApp.java`. Objects that handle the specifics of the Blackjack game are found under `src/com/skilldistillery/gamelogic`, the primary handler of the game loop being the `BlackjackTable` object. Players have 1000 currency to start and can win more or lost it all during the course of the game.

## Lessons Learned
Mostly putting into practice the use of Enums in Java. My previous Jets project incorporated more work on individual objects, however, this was a more logical exercise in their use with each other.

## Technologies Used
Java 1.8, MAC OS, Eclipse IDE, Bash Terminal, and git.

## Things I Could've Done Better
The menu interface leaves plenty to be desired even for a console application. I also think there was room to concise with method call hierarchies and inheritance with classes.
